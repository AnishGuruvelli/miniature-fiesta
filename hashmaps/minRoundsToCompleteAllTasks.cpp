// From observation, we can see that there's only 3 possible outcomes.

//     If the frequency is 1, the task cannot be performed so we return -1.
//     If the frequency is 3, the task can be performed and we return frequency/3.
//     Now if the frequency is not completely divisible by 3, then the possible remainders are 1 and 2. Lets check them out:

//     If remainder is 1, i.e, lets take 7 frequency, then ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”® the groups are something like this "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®" "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®" "ðŸ”®", i.e, one ðŸ”® is left alone so the solution is to break the second last group into two parts of 2 and 1 so that it becomes like: "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®" "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®" "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®", i.e, one is added to the division by 3.
//     If remainder is 2, i.e, lets take 8 frequency, then ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”® the groups are something like this "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®" "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®ðŸ”®" "ðŸ”®ðŸ”®", i.e, two ðŸ”® are left so the solution is to just add 1,i.e, one group of two to the solution.
